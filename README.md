### Project decomposition 

### Technologies to implement:
### Docker
Docker will be used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and easing deployment.

### Redis
Redis will be used as a caching layer and a message broker for Celery.

### Celery
Celery will handle periodic tasks such as sending notifications at specified intervals.

### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ can be used as a message broker for Celery to handle task queues, although Redis can also serve this purpose.

### Swagger
Swagger will be used to document the API, making it easier for third-party services and users to interact with it.

### Structure:
* users (Django app for user management and authentication)
* subscriptions (Django app for managing user subscriptions)
* notifications (Django app for handling notifications)
* weather (Django app for interacting with the weather API)
* api (Django app for providing RESTful endpoints)
* celery.py (Celery configuration)
* docker-compose.yml (Docker Compose configuration)
* Dockerfile (Docker configuration)
* settings.py (Django settings)
